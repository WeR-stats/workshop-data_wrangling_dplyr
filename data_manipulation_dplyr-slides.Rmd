# Why Data Wrangling?

 - Make data structures suitable to use with a particular piece of software / package

--

 - Reveal information otherwise hidden from view

--

 - Also called: Data Munging, Janitor Work, Data Transformation, ...

--

 - However it's called, it can take up to 80% of the analysis time


---
# Why Data Wrangling?

 - Two main *tidyverse* packages: `dplyr` and `tidyr`

--

 - Other packages: `data.table`, `janitor`, ...

--

 - `data.table` is more efficient and compact than `dplyr`, but it's also more difficult to learn
  
---
# Data Wrangling: *tidydata*

 - Data come in many formats

--

 - We usually aim at tabular datasets such that:

--

   1. Each variable is saved in its own column

--

   2. Each observation is saved in its own row

--

   3. Each *coherent* type of observations are stored in a single dataset

--
  
 The complying dataset then represent the state of an *entity*

 
---
# *dplyr* Introduction

 - Great for data exploration and transformation

--

 - Intuitive to write and easy to read, especially when using the “chaining” syntax

--

 - Faster than *core R* on data frames

--

 - Work also with data.table and data stored in databases


---
# *dplyr* Introduction

 - Most jobs are done using just the main two *verbs* `select` and `filter`

--

 - Easy *merge* with variations

--

 - Provides also *Window functions* for calculating ranking, offsets, and more
 

---
# *dplyr* Introduction

 - the first argument is a data frame

--

 - the return value is *always* a data frame
 
--

 - nothing is modified in place

--
 
 - no need to repeat the dataframe name

--

 - often no need to quote column names

--

 - in general, *dplyr* does not preserve row names
 

---
# *dplyr* Introduction

In the following we'll use the dataset *flights* from the package `nycflights13` that contains information about all flights that departed in 2013 from the three New York City airports:
 - `JFK` John F. Kennedy International Airport, primarily handles international flights
 - `LGA` LaGuardia AirportCentral Parkway), mainly handles domestic flights
 - `EWR` Newark International Airport (EWR), handles both domestic and international flights
 
---
# *dplyr* Introduction

The package provides the following data tables
 - `flights` all flights that departed from NYC in 2013
 - `airports` airport names and locations
 - `weather` hourly meterological data for each airport
 - `planes` construction information about each plane
 - `airlines` translation between two letter carrier codes and names

---
# *dplyr* Introduction

The `flights` dataset contains 19 variables
.font70[
```{r}
  tbl_df(flights)
```
]

---
# *dplyr* Introduction

.font60[
```{r}
  glimpse(flights)
```
]


---
# *dplyr* Pipe Operator `%>%`

This operator allows you to *pipe* the output from one function to the input of another function. 

Instead of nesting functions as usual (reading from the inside to the outside), the idea of of piping is to read the functions from left to right:

 `x %>% f(y) is equivalent to f(x, y)`
 
 `y %>% f(x, .) is equivalent to f(x, y)`
 
To be able to work in the tidyverse, a function needs to accept a dataset as first argument

---
# *dplyr* verbs: *select*

To extract certain columns from the data frame
The order in which you add them, will determine the order in which they appear in the output

```{r eval=FALSE}

# Select columns by name(s)
flights %>% select(origin, dest, year, dep_delay)

# Select all columns between two columns, by names or positions
flights %>% select(year:dep_delay)
flights %>% select(c(1:3, 7:9))

# To drop columns include a minus sign in front of the selection
flights %>% select(-tailnum)
flights %>% select(-(year:dep_delay))

```

---
# *dplyr* verbs: *select* helpers

Select all columns whose names:

 - `starts_with()` *start* with the specified prefix
 - `ends_with()` *end* with the specified suffix
 - `contains()` *contain* the specified string
 - `matches()` match a *regular expression*

Insert `ignore.case = TRUE` in any of the above to differentiate between upper and lower case


---
# *dplyr* verbs: *select* helpers

 - `num_range()` select all columns whose names match a numerical pattern range, starting with the `prefix` character(s)
 - `one_of()` select columns whose names are in the specified vector of names
 - `!!` same as `one_of`
 - `everything()` select every column (mostly used to reorder some columns while keeping all the columns)
 - `last_col()` select last column, set `offset` to `n` to select the *n*th columns from the end
 - `group_cols()` select all columns that act as *grouping* variables (see below)

---
# *dplyr* verbs: *pull*

When you need a vector as a result intead of a dataframe of one single column

Compare
   
   `flights %>% pull(tailnum)`

with

   `flights %>% select(tailnum)`

---
# *dplyr* verbs: *rename*

 - rename 'tailnum' with 'tail_num'
 
   `flights %>% rename(tail_num = tailnum)`

--

 - It is also possible to renaming variables while selecting, but you lose all unspecified variables. 
   Instead, `rename()` keeps all the variables.

--

 - On the other hand, `select()` can rename variables in a group using a numeric pattern:

  `flights %>% select(dep = contains('dep'))`


---
# *dplyr* verbs: *filter*

To extract a subset of rows based on one or more condition

```{r eval=FALSE}

flights %>% filter( dep_delay > 10 ) 

flights %>% filter( arr_delay < dep_delay ) 

flights %>% filter( hour < 12, arr_delay <= 0 )

```

---
# *dplyr* verbs: *arrange*

Allows to reorder a dataframe based on one or more columns

```{r eval=FALSE}
flights %>% 
    filter( hour > 10 ) %>% 
    arrange(year, month, day)

flights %>% 
    filter( origin == 'JFK', dep_delay > 15 ) %>% 
    arrange(desc(dep_delay))
```

---
# *dplyr* verbs: *mutate*

Add or modify columns based on the values of other columns

```{r eval=FALSE}
flights %>% 
    mutate(
        gain = arr_delay - dep_delay, 
        speed = distance / air_time * 60
    ) %>% 
    filter(gain > 0) %>% 
    arrange(desc(speed)) %>% 
    head()
```

---
# *dplyr* verbs: *summarize*

Collapse a dataframe into one row

```{r eval=FALSE}

flights %>% 
  summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

flights %>% 
  filter(dep_delay > 0) %>% 
  summarise(arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

```


---
# *dplyr* verbs: *summarise* helpers

All the following functions take a vector as input and return a scalar

 - `first()` first value in a vector
 - `last()` last value in a vector
 - `nth()` *n*-th value in a vector
 - `n()` the total number of values in a vector
 - `n_distinct()` the number of *distinct* values in a vector


---
# *dplyr* verbs: *group_by*

Group observations according to the values of one or more columns. 
It is usually combined with `summarize` to determine transformations for each group

```{r eval=FALSE}

flights %>% 
    group_by(dest) %>% 
    summarise(planes = n_distinct(tailnum), flights = n()) %>% 
    arrange(desc(flights))
```

---
# *dplyr* verbs: *group_by*

```{r eval=FALSE}
flights %>% 
    group_by(tailnum) %>% 
    summarise(
        count = n(), 
        dist = round(mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE)), 
        delay = round(mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), 2) 
    ) %>% 
    filter(is.finite(delay)) %>% 
    arrange(desc(count))
```


---
# *dplyr* functions

 - `n()` count the number of rows

--
 
 - `distinct()` count the number of unique rows, eliminating duplications

--
 
 - `top_n()`

--

 - `sample_n()` selects *size* random rows from a dataframe

--

 - `sample_frac()` selects a fraction *size* of random rows 

---
# *dplyr* joins 

 - `bind_cols()`
 
 - `bind_rows()`
 
 - `union()`
 
 - `intersect()`
 
 - `setdiff()`

---
# *dplyr* joins: *inner_join*

 - Return all rows from `x` where there are matching values in `y`, and all columns from `x` and `y`
 
--

 - If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combinations of the matches are returned

--
 
 - This is a *mutating* join

---
# *dplyr* joins: *inner_join*

 - single key, same name
  
   `inner_join(x, y, 'id')` 

--
 
 - single key, different names
 
   `inner_join(x, y, c('idx' = 'idy'))` 

--
 
 - composite key, same names
 
   `inner_join(x, y, c('id1', 'id2'))` 

--
 
 - composite key, different names
 
   .font90[`inner_join(x, y, c('id1x' = 'id1y', 'id2x' = 'id2y'))`]
 
   

---
# *dplyr* joins: *inner_join*

```{r eval=FALSE}
flights %>% 
    group_by(dest) %>% 
    summarise(planes = n_distinct(tailnum), flights = n()) %>% 
    arrange(desc(flights)) %>% 
    inner_join(airports, by = c('dest' = 'faa'))
```

---
# *dplyr* joins: *left_join*

`left_join(x, y, 'id')` 

 - Return all rows from `x`, and all columns from `x` and `y`
 
--

 - If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, *all* combination of the matches are returned
 
--

 - This is a *mutating* join



---
# *dplyr* joins: *full_join*

 - Return all rows from `x` and `y`, and all columns from `x` and `y`
 
--

 - Unmatched rows are replaced with missing values
 
--

 - This is a *mutating* join


---
# *dplyr* joins

`semi_join(x, y, 'id')`

 - Return all rows from `x` where there are matching values in `y`, keeping just columns from `x`

--
 
 - A semi join also differs from an inner join because it will *never* duplicate rows of `x` 

--
 
 - This is a *filtering* join


---
# *dplyr* joins

`anti_join(x, y, 'id')`

 - Return all rows from `x` where there are not matching values in `y`, keeping just columns from `x`

--
 
 - This is a *filtering* join
